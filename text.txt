Its my job to fix the internet before anyone notices. Today I have a special mission I need your help with. The popular Smoogle search engine has been acting up. The image tags like this one, have gone bonkers. When the logo image becomes unstable, and falls into its pieces, it will be your job to assemble them in the correct order to fix the code. When you believe you have ordered them correctly, press "check answer".
